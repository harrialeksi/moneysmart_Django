        <p>
          The borrowing process of online loans is done primarily online, from
          application, instant approval to funding. You may even be able to get
          your funds as soon as the same business day. This stands different
          from most loans that you would apply for through a brick-and-mortar
          location. Online loans can help you to weather the storm when you’re
          facing emergency expenses.

        <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
          What are the benefits of online loans? Why is the interest rate lower?
          Is it free from TU? MoneySmart has put together an arsenal of answers
          for you:
        </p>
        <div class="my-3">
          <h3 class="fs-5">1. Lower borrowing cost</h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            As the name suggests, the entire borrowing process of online loans
            is done completely online. That is why its operating cost is much
            lower than its brick-and-mortar counterparts, enabling it to launch
            loans such as WeLend Personal Loan and UA i-Money Express Online
            Personal Loan that are characterized by lower or no interest rates
            and free of any administrative charges.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="my-3">
          <h3 class="fs-5">2. Instant Approval and Disbursement + TU Free</h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            Some online loans don't require proof of income or TU, making the
            entire application process so much easier, which is ideal for
            applicants facing emergency expenses. However, it is important to
            note that these loans usually come with higher interest rates.
            Therefore, you should think twice before taking out these loans.
          </p>

        <div class="my-3">
          <h3 class="fs-5">
            3. Online Loan applications are open even during weekend
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            The entire borrowing process of online loans is not done manually.
            That’s why it’s not restricted to working hours. Applicants can
            apply online loans anytime, even during weekends. Many money lenders
            even offer instant approval and disbursement loans on weekends such
            as PrimeCredit Fixed Loan.

        <div class="my-3">
          <h3 class="fs-5">4. Enjoy Cashback</h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            Enjoy extra cashback when applying loans online. For example, if you
            apply for UA "NO SHOW" Personal Loan via MoneySmart before 31 Aug
            2021, you can enjoy up to HK$5,000 Welcome Cash Reward + Extra
            Nintendo Switch Lite or HK$1,500 supermarket voucher.

          Unlike applying for loans in person, there is no one walking you

          applicable to your loan application when applying online. However, you
          can leave this with MoneySmart. You can compare different loans

          Banks VS Licensed Money Leaders |Can you trust HK Money Lenders?
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          The benefits of borrowing from a licensed moneylender in HK are that
          they offer instant approval and they usually come with fewer
          restrictions with regard to your income, credit history and the
          documents required. Usually, banks would only extend personal loans to
          applicants with a stable income and good credit history.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          With licensed moneylenders, you can even get the loan approved and
          funds within minutes, and they don’t scrutinise your credit history as
          much as the bank does. However, you usually end up paying higher
          interest rates than you would at a bank.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          So personal loans should only be taken out for a specific purpose,
          with a focused plan on repayment. Find the best Personal Loan for you
          on MoneySmart, where you can compare all interest rates at one glance!
