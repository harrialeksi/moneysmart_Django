            Find a suitable loan product that best fits your financial needs.
            Make sure you read the fine print and understand the loan structure.
            Once selected, fill in the application form and submit all the
            required documents.

            Citibank Loan Specialist will then contact you within 1-2 working
            days to finalize the terms of the loan. If the loan is eventually
            approved, you will be required to visit a designated branch to go
            through the loan disbursement process.

            If you are applying for Card Debt Consolidation Loans, you will be
            required to sign the drawdown letter so that Citibank can settle
            your card debt with other financial institutions. For other loan
            types, your loan will be disbursed instantly via cash, cheque or
            credit into your designated bank account

        <h3 class="fs-3">Citibank Loan Offers & Promotions</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          Like every other bank or money lender, Citibank sometimes offers
          seasonal promotions for their personal loan products, such as low APR
          rates, cash coupons, even gifts such as tablets. These sweeteners are
          no doubt appealing, but as a consumer, you should protect yourself by
          paying special attention to the fine print of these offers. Loan
          promotions that advertise low APR rates tend to be limited to specific
          loan amounts and repayment periods, and they may be modelled based on
          a different interest rate structure than what you're actually getting.
          Check that the promotional loan repayment structure is something you
          would be comfortable committing to first. Welcome gifts such as cash
          coupons are sometimes given with no strings attached, but in other
          cases, banks are able to "claw back" the gift if you do not fulfil
          certain requirements set out in the terms & conditions. Warning: You
          have to repay your loans. Don't pay any intermediaries.

                  Citibank accepts several documents to prove your income. It's

                  stamp/letterhead), but if this is not available, you can also
                  submit your bank statement or account passbook showing your

      <p>
        APR (interest rate) may be the most prominent cost component of your
        personal loan, but it is by no means the only one! You should also be
        aware of the following fees that Citibank may charge in various
        scenarios.
      </p>
      <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col-md-6 my-3 col-lg-4 my-lg-2">

            Handling Fee
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            Citibank advertises a 0% handling fee for their personal loans, but
            it is possible that this fee is simply absorbed into the APR. Do
            compare personal loans across banks to make sure you have the best
            rate.

            Early Repayment Fee
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            Kudos to you for clearing your personal loan early, but there will
            be a fee for doing so. This is typically 1.5% of the principal loan
            amount but it varies a little depending on when exactly you make
            early repayment.
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            It is possible to extend your repayment date, but you will be
            charged a Daily Extension Fee at the same interest rate of your
            personal loan. The maximum extension Citibank will grant you is 45
            days.
