          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            Find a suitable loan product that best fits your financial needs. Make sure you read the fine print and understand the loan structure. Once selected, fill in the application form and submit all the required documents. You can do this online in a matter of minutes.

          <h3 class="fs-5">Wait for Your Loan Approval Result</h3>
          <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
            WeLend has a two-step approval system. First, you will get preliminary approval by SMS and email within one working day of your online application. Once you get that, you can proceed to submit your supporting documents. A WeLend Loan Specialist will then contact you for verification and to confirm the loan agreement.

            For WeLend personal loans, if the verification and loan agreement process is done before 1.30pm, the funds will be transferred to your disbursement account on the same day. For debt consolidation loans, WeLend will also transfer the outstanding amounts to the financial institutions on the same day.

                Here's a quick primer on how and what to submit to WeLend when applying for a personal loan from them.

                </h3>
                <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
                  There are four supporting documents you have to submit to WeLend after obtaining your preliminary loan approval. (1) A copy of your HKID. (2) Proof of your disbursement account. (3) Residential proof, e.g. an official letter or bill stating both your name and address. (4) Payslips or other proof of income (1 month for fixed salary earners, 3 months for commission-based earners, and 6 months for real estate workers). If you are applying for the WeLend No Document Loan, you only need to submit (1) and (2).

                <p class="mb-0 pb-0">
                  The best way to submit your documents is through the WeLend website. You will get an account after submitting an online application; log in to your account and you will be able to upload the documents from your computer or mobile phone. Otherwise, you can also send the documents to WeLend via email (doc@welend.hk), WhatsApp (5633-5939), LINE (Welend.hk) or fax Faxï¼š3590-3991

      <h2 class="fs-2">WeLend Loan Fees & Charges</h2>
      <p>
        One of WeLend's key selling points is that there are no hidden charges and fees. There is a handling fee for each loan, but this is incorporated into the APR when they calculate your loan interest rate. However, if you miss the deadline for a payment, WeLend will change a HK$350 "service fee" per late repayment. You will be notified by email, and there are no further penalties for late payment. It is also possible to settle your WeLend loan ahead of schedule without paying any early settlement fees. You just need to inform WeLend at least 30 days in advance by WhatsApp (5633-5939) or email (cs@welend.hk).
